# HandDrawnDigitRecognition demo

---

this is a simple demo to showcase my Neural Network java library. It was originally part of my A-level final project for computer science

## Usage

I probably wouldn't bother looking in the code because its not my finest work but if you download the exe from the releases you can draw numbers on the screen and the AI will try to tell you what they are.
The model gets about 93% accuracy on the MNIST dataset which is what it was trained on. However, the images produced from drawing on the screen are not the same as the MNIST images so the model is not quite so good at classifying them, but it does work.

click and drag on the pop up window to draw a digit 0 - 9. press enter to submit your drawing. Your previous drawing will be displayed in the top left corner and the guess from the AI will be displayed at the top.
